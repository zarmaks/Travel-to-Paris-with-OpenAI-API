# Travel-to-Paris-with-OpenAI-API
As a developer at a leading tech company, your assignment is to construct a comprehensive AI-powered Parisian travel guide.

In this project, you will utilize OpenAI's language processing capabilities to answer pre-defined travel-related queries intelligently, offering customized recommendations for exploring Paris.

Create a model variable to use OpenAI's 'gpt-3.5-turbo' model, to find answers to the following questions:

1.How far away is the Louvre from the Eiffel Tower (in miles) if you are driving?
2.Where is the Arc de Triomphe?
3.What are the must-see artworks at the Louvre Museum?
